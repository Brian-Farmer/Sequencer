### Sequencer using Sonic Pi and Processing.

This Project is still a work in progress.
_And will only work with Processing 3.5.4 or below_

## Description:
This is a small Sequencer written with Processing and communicating to SonicPi using OSC.
You can play a base, a hi hat, a snare,  a percussion and a melody. On every instrument you can change the release, attack and the rate of the sound. The Melody can also be sliced with all 4 waveforms.

## Usage:
Start SonicPi and open up the file "sequencer.rb" and run it. Then open up and run "sequencer_ui.pde" with Processing 3.5.4. Its important you installed the dependencies first. If both are opened correctly in order, you should be able to use the sequencer.


## Dependencies:
- oscP5
- controlP5
